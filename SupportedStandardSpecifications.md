# Introduction #

IMS standard as defined by 3GPP is a vast collection of specifications that define interaction procedures between an IMS User Equipment (UE) and an IMS Core Network. These specifications refer extensively to Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documents. More, Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) has also considered IMS related use cases hence a few specifications have been published as part of their work. All these specification cover the possible scenarios and behaviors imagined. Implementing a UE that is 100% compliant to the 3GPP specs is neither possible nor needed. This page lists the standard specifications that are taken into consideration when implementing by IMS Protocol Stack - add name here.
